title: Short downtime on the 30. June 2013

On the 30. June 2013 we are expecting a short downtime of the [Donation
Service](https://donations.sigimera.org) during the afternoon (CET). The reason for the interruption
is the change of the underlying application server. This change results in
smoother releases for all upcoming versions.

We are sorry for any incoinvenience and are trying to keep the downtime as
short as possible.
